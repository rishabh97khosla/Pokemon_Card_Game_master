# Pokémon card game

### What are Pokémon exactly ?

Well a fun fact is that pokemons are called as pocket monsters in japan. The franchise was created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1995 , and is centered on fictional creatures called "Pokémon" which humans, known as Pokémon Trainers, catch and train to battle each other for sport.
 
"Gotta Catch 'Em All". is the famous phrase used within the Pokémon universe.

As children we really enjoyed watching Pokémon on televison and we stil do. There is no age barrier to watching Pokémon , playing Pokémon console games or Pokémon cards 

so here is a attempt at recreating the pokemon card game 

#### The rules of the game have been specified by my understanding of the game .. feel free to change the rules if you wish to.

- The game consists of  5 rounds played by player and computer in consecutive steps 
- Each Round has 3 cards dealt to choose from 
- Each Card has HP , Attack , Defense , Speed , Legendary as options to choose from 
- Each Round has a winner and the maximum Round won will decide the winner of the game , well there is always a possibilty of tie 

#### Rounds description 
- Round 1 -> player chooses the card and the power to compare it with his opponent
- Round 2 -> Computer chooses the card and the power , player gets to decide just the card as a response to the computers card 
- Round 3 -> Same as Round 1
- Round 4 -> Same as Round 2
- Round 5 -> Same as Round 1
